      ## Chobble Template News

      On a real website this is where you'd list your news posts - saving your visitors from needing to click through to your [Facebook]({{ site.socials.Facebook }}) or [Mastodon]({{ site.socials.Mastodon }}) pages to learn about what you've been up to.

      Your news posts are also pulled through to the [RSS Feed](/feed.xml), which also looks tidy and explains what RSS is - pretty neat, no?
