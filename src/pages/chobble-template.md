      ## Static HTML, Optimised Images

      The output is plain HTML and CSS with no client-side framework. Images are processed at build time into multiple sizes and WebP format with blurred placeholders.

      - **LQIP Placeholders** - Inline base64 blurred previews, no extra requests
      - **Responsive Images** - Multiple sizes generated at build time via srcset
      - **Link Prefetch** - Pages preload on hover
      - **Static Output** - No server-side rendering, just HTML files

        /img/abc-900.webp 900w"

      Automatic. No configuration needed.

      ## Hosting and Deployment

      Includes a GitHub Actions workflow. Push to main and it deploys to Neocities or Bunny CDN. Since the output is static files, any web host works.

      **Included deployment targets:**

      - Neocities (has a free tier)
      - Bunny CDN (global edge network)
      - Any static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

      I can host your site for **£10/month** (or **£5/month** for charities, co-ops, artists, musicians, and sustainable businesses) — hosting and backups included, no support. Or self-host wherever you like.

      Bunny Edge Script-based backend.
